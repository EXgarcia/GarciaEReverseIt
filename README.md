Minei challenge #7 "Reverse it"
In this project the console will prompt the user to input numbers and return them in reverse order.

Review: Jasmine Leek - program runs as expected, tested under multiple conditions including numbers, letters and special characters. I love the additional doodle in the "mirror" and at the end!
